    "* There is no single answer to most problems in deep learning, therefore the questions will often be underspecified. You need to fill in the blanks and submit a solution that solves the (practical) problem. Document the choices (hyperparameters, features, neural network architectures, etc.) you made where specified.\n",
    "* All the code should be written in Python.\n",
    "* You may include any code used in previous projects. You may use ChatGPT, but you need to document how you use it.\n",
    "* You should expect that a complete training session should last about 6 hours, so you should start part (b) as early as you can!\n",
    "* To save on compute time, we debugging locally and using colab to train. Or use colab cpu instance for debugging\n",

    "Some notes about generating the ground truth targets:\n",
    "* The FPN levels can be though of as different grid sizes cut through the image.\n",
    "* You assign each target to a certain FPN level if $\\sqrt{wh}$ from the bounding box falls within the `scale_range` associated with that level. Note that these overlap, so you may assign the same target to multiple levels.\n",
    "* A grid cell should be considered as predicting an object if that grid cell falls into the \"centre region\" of the object.\n",
    " * The centre region of an object is its bounding box scaled by `epsilon`.\n",
    " * Each grid cell can predict at most one object, but each object can be predicted by more than one grid cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Target Visualization\n",
    "You should produce visualizations such as fig. 8 and 9 to validate your target assignments.\n",
